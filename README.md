# Gender-and-Age-Detection
The Gender and Age Detection project is a computer vision application designed to automatically estimate the gender and age range of a person based on facial image analysis. This system leverages deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained on large datasets containing labeled facial images.
